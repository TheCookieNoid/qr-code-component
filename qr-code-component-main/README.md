## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```html
<div class="container"></div>
```
```css
@media (min-width: 500px){
    .container{
        width: 400px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Learning and using flex is still a challenge for me, practicing it would be helpful. This challenge involved the use of it so it really cleared some of my questions.

### Useful resources
